# Nyubis TADA68 layout

My personal TADA68 layout.

* Tilde and backtick in top left
* Escape is on the Caps Lock key
* Caps Lock on Fn + Caps Lock
* Delete in top right, next to backspace
* Home and End without Fn, PgUp and PgDn require Fn
* Volume buttons more logically positioned (M for mute)
* Paste from primary selection button next to Enter
* Fn can be held, or tapped to apply to just the next keystroke
* Right Alt pretends to be Left Alt when held (right alt is my compose key)
* Additional layer toggled with Fn+Enter, contains application specific combos
